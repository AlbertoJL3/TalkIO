## Description
Welcome to TalkIO! This project showcases the Model-View-Controller paradigm that composes an app for users that can create and login to their accounts and chat. The app only has a single server or "room" as we call it. The goal was to showcase the use of SocketIO's web sockets for real-time messaging. 
# Tech Used:
 HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, MySQL2, Sequelize, BCrypt, .env, API, HandleBars, Socket.iO
